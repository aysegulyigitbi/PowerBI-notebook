# Power BI: Charts and Applications

👋 Hey there! Let's talk about Power BI Charts and their usage. With Power BI, visualizing and presenting our reports with data has never been easier! 📊

Creating actionable reports and dashboards that clarify and strengthen our purpose is made easy with Power BI.

Power BI Visual Elements include:

· Charts

· Cards

· Maps

· Slicers

· Tables

· KPIs

In this article, we will take a closer look at charts which form the backbone of visual elements. 📈

When creating a Power BI dashboard, visuals are the most eye-catching things. When you look at the Power BI visualization gallery, you will see plenty of visual types.

There are many types of visualization techniques in Power BI. The most important and commonly used one is charts. Charts are basically used to display data to a user in every report or dashboard.

Charts are one of the essential tools that can make the use of numerical data sets in any dashboard understandable. However, can we use every chart in every dataset? Of course not.

To create the right type of chart in a dataset, we need to know the input and output of the chart. We should be selective when creating charts because not all charts are suitable for every type of dataset. So let's start examining chart types to find the right one.

📊 Stacked Bar Chart

The Stacked Bar Chart displays numerical values over time and compares values between different groups represented by vertical rectangular bars in a graph. The bars also have categorical values separated by lines within them. Each bar on the graph represents a whole and is divided into sub-bars representing different categories.

The Cost of Goods Sold and Profit are represented on the x-axis with different shades of blue, while the quarter numbers are shown on the y-axis.

A Stacked Bar Chart can be used to display a company's total sales by quarter. Then, we can divide the bars into two categories representing the Profit Margin for each category. In this chart, we can find out how much of Total Sales for each Category is Profit against Cost of Goods Sold.

📊 Stacked Bar Chart

Stacked Bar Chart visualizes numerical values over time and compares the values between different groups represented by rectangular bars in the graph. These bars are further divided into categorical values that are separated by lines within each bar. Each bar in the graph represents a whole, which is divided into sub-bars representing different categories.

📊 Clustered Bar Chart

The Clustered Bar Chart is one of the commonly used visualizations in Power BI. They are horizontal bar charts that represent the graphical representation of selected category data points. Bar charts are used to show the number of units sold and sales values of different categories.

The Clustered Bar Chart displays the number of units sold "By Category". It is a great way to compare the number of units sold across different categories.

Get ready to see how your categories stack up against each other! 💪🔥

📊 Clustered Column Chart

This type of chart is the opposite of the Clustered Bar Chart we just talked about. Instead of horizontal bars, it uses vertical bars to visualize data.

Clustered Column Charts are great for comparing numerical values across different categories over time. In the example below, we're looking at the Sales and Cost values over a three-month period.

📊 Line and Stacked Column Chart

Line and Stacked Column Chart is the perfect combination of a column and line chart. It allows us to compare two sets of data at once, making it an essential tool for businesses!

For example, if we want to compare our monthly sales and cost values, we can use the "Line and Stacked Column Chart" to visualize our data points.

Check out the chart below to see how it displays "Category-Based Sales and Cost Value". 🤑💰

📊 Area Charts

Area charts are a sophisticated type of line chart where the area between the axis and the line is filled to show the volume. They are a fundamental table that displays the comparison of two or more quantities. By showing the gap between one data point and another, area charts provide us with a useful structure for making decisions about whether sales are increasing or decreasing over a certain period.

The chart below shows the area between sales value, cost value, and the number of units sold for each category. 📊💰📦

📊 Ribbon Graph

Ribbon Graph, displays categorized and ordered data through stripes; where the highest ranking is always displayed on the top stripe for each period. Ribbon Graph helps us visualize how a particular category is ranked over a period of time.

📈 Ribbon Graph below shows Total Sales by Quarter, where quarters are on the x-axis and different colored stripes represent different products. Although the y-axis label has been removed, Total Sales is still represented on the y-axis.

For an example such as the Total Sales ranking for a Product sold every quarter, using a Strip Graph would be the right choice. With the Strip Graph, we can clearly visualize which company's product was ranked as the best-selling in each quarter.

📊 Line Graphs

Line graphs are a simple but powerful way to visualize trends in data over time. By plotting data points on a two-dimensional graph and connecting them with straight lines, we can quickly and easily see how a particular variable is changing over a given time period.

Whether you're tracking sales figures, website traffic, or any other type of data, a line graph can help you identify trends and make informed decisions about your business or organization. So next time you're looking to analyze data, consider using a line graph to make sense of the numbers!

📊 Pie Chart

The Power BI Pie Chart displays the proportion of each category against the total value.🥧

The above chart represents a data point of the total units by buyer in the Pie Chart.

By looking at this Pie Chart, we can determine that the buyers who purchased a large number of units were "Bruce Curran, Chris Monroe, and Richard Carr".

📊 Donut Chart

Donut Chart, is a type of pie chart that looks like a ring instead of a solid circle. Unlike the traditional pie chart, the donut chart does not include the central area, creating a ring-shaped visualization.

Donut Charts are particularly useful for showing the proportion of each category within a whole. The larger the donut, the more significant the category in relation to the whole.

For example, in the donut chart above, we can see the percentage of monthly expenses for a household budget. The donut chart shows that the largest expense is the mortgage, accounting for 40% of the total expenses.

📊 Funnel Charts

Funnel charts are great for visualizing the flow of data, such as a sales funnel where leads enter at the top and gradually convert into sales at the bottom. With a Funnel Chart, you can easily see the stages where the highest drop-off occurs, helping you identify areas that need improvement.

For example, you can use a Funnel Chart to see the conversion rates of website visitors who start the checkout process but don't complete it. By identifying the stage where most visitors drop off, you can optimize that stage to increase the overall conversion rate.

📊 Waterfall Chart

The waterfall chart is an excellent tool for visualizing the positive/negative contributions to a starting value and the result! The first column shows the start value and the last column shows the ending value.

📈 Uses of a waterfall chart include visualizing profit and loss charts, comparing product earnings, highlighting budget changes in projects, analyzing inventory/sales, displaying product value over a period of time, and creating admin dashboards.

📊 Bubble Chart

Bubble charts represent data in a circular shape, where the values of variables are represented by the x and y axes, and the size of the circle represents the measurement of the variables.
