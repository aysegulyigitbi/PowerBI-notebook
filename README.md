# Bravo for Power BI

Hello everyone, We can analyze our complex models and improve the performance of our reports with Bravo for Power BI. It also provides us with user-friendly features to facilitate our DAX measurements and data export. Bravo does not replace more advanced tools such as DAX Studio and Tabular Editor, but it offers new users of Power BI the opportunity to use simple features in their reports without the complexity of other tools and to perform analysis.

Bravo in 4 Steps

1) Analyze Model

With Bravo, we can quickly analyze and optimize which columns to remove to see where our model is consuming the most memory. We can also use it to transfer our metadata to VPAX files.

3) Manage Dates

We can use Bravo to create a Date table with different calendar templates, options, languages and holidays for different countries in our model.

Bravo can also add DAX metrics that implement the most common time intelligence calculations.
