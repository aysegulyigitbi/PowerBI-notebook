# Power BI DAX: ALL, ALLEXCEPT, ALLSELECTED, REMOVEFILTERS

In today's world, data analysis and visualization play a critical role in enabling businesses to make strategic decisions. In this context, powerful data analysis tools like Power BI allow users to make sense of complex data and create impactful reports. Power BI's DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions make data models dynamic and interactive, enhancing the depth of analyses. In this article, we will review a report I created using DAX functions in Power BI, detailing essential DAX functions such as ALL, ALLEXCEPT, ALLSELECTED, REMOVEFILTERS, and exploring other functions that can be used as alternatives. This article provides the necessary knowledge and tools to help you analyze your data more effectively and optimize your reports.

## DAX Functions

### 1. ALL Function
The ALL function removes all filters from a specified table or column. This function is typically used to calculate overall totals for measures.

### 2. ALLEXCEPT Function
The ALLEXCEPT function removes all filters except those from specified columns. This function is useful when you want to calculate a total for a specific group.

### 3. ALLSELECTED Function
The ALLSELECTED function removes all filters except those that are explicitly selected. This allows calculations without affecting the data visualizations when slicers or filters are used.

### 4. REMOVEFILTERS Function
The REMOVEFILTERS function removes filters from specified tables or columns. It is similar to the ALL function but has a more flexible and readable syntax.

### 5. KEEPFILTERS Function
The KEEPFILTERS function applies additional filters while retaining the existing ones. This is useful when you do not want to change the filtering behavior.

### 6. FILTER Function
The FILTER function filters a table based on a specified criterion. This function is useful for more complex filtering requirements.
