In this article, we will take a closer look at charts which form the backbone of visual elements. 📈

When creating a Power BI dashboard, visuals are the most eye-catching things. When you look at the Power BI visualization gallery, you will see plenty of visual types.

There are many types of visualization techniques in Power BI. The most important and commonly used one is charts. Charts are basically used to display data to a user in every report or dashboard.

Charts are one of the essential tools that can make the use of numerical data sets in any dashboard understandable. However, can we use every chart in every dataset? Of course not.

To create the right type of chart in a dataset, we need to know the input and output of the chart. We should be selective when creating charts because not all charts are suitable for every type of dataset. So let's start examining chart types to find the right one. 📊

#Stacked Bar Chart

The Stacked Bar Chart displays numerical values over time and compares values between different groups represented by vertical rectangular bars in a graph. The bars also have categorical values separated by lines within them. Each bar on the graph represents a whole and is divided into sub-bars representing different categories.

The Cost of Goods Sold and Profit are represented on the x-axis with different shades of blue, while the quarter numbers are shown on the y-axis.

A Stacked Bar Chart can be used to display a company's total sales by quarter. Then, we can divide the bars into two categories representing the Profit Margin for each category. In this chart, we can find out how much of Total Sales for each Category is Profit against Cost of Goods Sold. 📊
